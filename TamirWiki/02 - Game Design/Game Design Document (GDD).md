# ðŸ“œ Game Design Document: Tamir

## 1. High Concept

Tamir is a custom-content Runescape private server, revision 317 loading OSRS data. The goal of Tamir is to develop gameplay with meaningful progression, engaging bossing, inside a world that feels new, but familiar.

## 2. Vision Statement

Our vision is to create an MMORPG that respects the "Gower-like" design principles of discovery, interconnected skills, and challenging, rewarding gameplay. We will introduce custom storylines, bosses, and skill modifications that feel like a natural extension of the original game's soul, rather than a departure from it. The world should feel cohesive, with every piece of new content having a purpose and a place within the established lore. The focus is on the journey, not just the destination.

## 3. Core Design Pillars

These are the guiding principles for all development decisions. Every new feature should be measured against these pillars.

- **Interconnected World**: All skills, quests, and new areas should feel connected. A new monster might drop an item needed for a new potion, which is used to defeat a new boss. Nothing exists in a vacuum.
    
- **Meaningful Progression**: Leveling up and acquiring new items should feel like a significant achievement. We will avoid overly fast progression or "catch-up" mechanics. Every level should unlock new, tangible content.
    
- **Discovery and Wonder**: The world should be full of secrets, hidden details, and challenges that are not immediately obvious. Players should be rewarded for exploration and experimentation.
    
- **Risk vs. Reward**: The best rewards should come from the most challenging content. From the Wilderness to difficult bosses, players should feel a sense of accomplishment from overcoming danger.
    

## 4. Target Audience

- Veterans of classic RuneScape who are looking for a fresh experience that still respects the original game's design.
    
- Players who enjoy long-term progression and the "grind" when it leads to meaningful rewards.
    
- Solo players and small groups who enjoy both skilling and PvM challenges.
