# ⛏️ Skilling Philosophy

## 1. Guiding Principles

Skilling in Tamir should be a viable and rewarding playstyle, not just a means to an end for combat. We aim for a balance between active, attention-required methods and more relaxed, "AFKable" methods for every skill.

- **Resource Interdependence**: Skills should feed into one another. Logs from [[Woodcutting]] are used for [[Fletching]] and [[Firemaking]]. Ores from [[Mining]] are used for [[Smithing]]. Herbs from [[Farming]] are used for [[Herblore]]. This creates a cohesive and self-sufficient world.
    
- **Skilling for Profit**: High-level skilling should be a reliable method for generating wealth. This can be through gathering rare resources (e.g., [[Magic Logs]], [[Runite Ore]]) or crafting high-demand items (e.g., potions, ammunition).
    
- **"Gower-like" Enhancements**: Our custom skilling mechanics, like the **[[Spirit of the Grove]]** in Woodcutting, are designed to add a layer of engagement and surprise to otherwise repetitive tasks, without fundamentally changing the core identity of the skill. Every skill should eventually have a similar unique mechanic.
    

## 2. Balancing Experience Rates

- **Active vs. AFK**: Methods that require more player attention and input should provide higher experience rates than methods that can be done while mostly AFK.
    
- **Resource vs. "Buyable"**: Gathering skills (Mining, Fishing, etc.) will generally have slower experience rates than artisan skills (Crafting, Herblore, etc.) where resources can be bought from other players. This ensures the value of raw materials.
