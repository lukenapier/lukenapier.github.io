### **yyyy-mm-dd**
**Focus:** Implementing the [[Grave Lord]] boss.
**Log:** Spent most of the day on the boss's model and getting it into the game. The animations look a bit stiff, but it's good enough for the alpha. I'm struggling with how to code the "Summon Skeleton" special attack. The current server logic for spawning NPCs wasn't designed for on-the-fly combat summons. I'll need to refactor a part of the `NPCManager.java` class. It feels like a big task, but it's necessary for future bosses too. Decided to keep the drop table simple for now to stick with the "Gower-like" feelâ€”no overly complex, multi-page drop tables.

**Log:** I have decided to finally treat this project with a bit of serious and respect. Here is where organization will improve, and hopefully progress will become more cohesive.
