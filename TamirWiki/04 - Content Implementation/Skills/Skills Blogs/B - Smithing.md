# Overview
The Smithing rework is going to be a *massive* change from the OSRS standard. Taking a lot of inspiration from RS3, smithing is going to be very *afk*, and much more focused on burning bars to create quality items, rather than creating tons of items to be sold to the general store, or alched.

### The Metal Bank
Ores and Bars will be storable in the metal bank, and they will only be usable from here. This will allow the player to smith items that take more than a full inventory of bars in one go.

---

### Smelting
Players will open the furnace interface and select which bar they wish to make. Provided they have enough ore in their metal bank, selecting 'smelt' starts converting ores into bars and dropping them into the player's inventory.
*master level perks will allow these bars to be smelted directly to the metal bank*
