# ðŸŒ¿ Herblore

## 1. Core Philosophy & Vision
Herblore is the artisan skill of cleaning herbs and mixing them into potions that provide temporary boosts, healing, and other unique effects. It is a crucial skill for any adventurer preparing for combat.

## 2. Herb Cleaning
The first step in Herblore is cleaning grimy herbs.

|---|---|---|---|
| [[Grimy Guam]] | [[Guam Leaf]] | 1 | 2.5 |
| [[Grimy Marrentill]] | [[Marrentill]] | 5 | 3.8 |
| [[Grimy Tarromin]] | [[Tarromin]] | 11 | 5.0 |

| [[Grimy Dwarf Weed]] | [[Dwarf Weed]] | 70 | 13.8 |
| [[Grimy Torstol]] | [[Torstol]] | 75 | 15.0 |

## 3. Potion Making
Potions are created in two steps: creating an unfinished potion, and then adding a secondary ingredient.

### Unfinished Potions (Clean Herb + Vial of Water)

|---|---|---|
| [[Guam Potion (unf)]] | [[Guam Leaf]] | 1 |
| [[Marrentill Potion (unf)]] | [[Marrentill]] | 5 |
| [[Tarromin Potion (unf)]] | [[Tarromin]] | 12 |
| [[Harralander Potion (unf)]] | [[Harralander]] | 22 |
| [[Ranarr Potion (unf)]] | [[Ranarr Weed]] | 30 |
| ...and so on for all herbs. | | |

### Finished Potions (Unfinished Potion + Secondary Ingredient)
