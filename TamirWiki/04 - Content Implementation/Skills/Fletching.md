## 3. Implementation Notes
-   `Fletching.java` is the main class that handles the skill logic and interfaces.
-   The `impl` package contains enums for each fletching action: `Carvable.java`, `Stringable.java`, `Featherable.java`, `Arrow.java`, `Bolt.java`, and `Crossbow.java`.
-   The `Fletchable` interface provides a common structure for all fletching activities.
