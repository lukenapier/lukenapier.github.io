## 3. Implementation Notes
-   The `Cooking.java` class handles the main logic for the skill.
-   The `CookData.java` enum contains all the data for cookable items.
-   The success formula for cooking is located in the `Cooking.java` class and is influenced by the player's Cooking level, the `noBurn` level of the food, and if the player has the [[Cooking Cape]] or [[Cooking Gauntlets]].
