# About this site

Welcome to Lucas’s Mind Garden — a digital space where notes from an Obsidian vault are rendered into a calm, browser-friendly reading experience. The site is generated automatically from Markdown files inside the `/vault` directory, so new ideas blossom with every commit.

## How it works

- **Content pipeline:** During each build, the vault is parsed and turned into an Astro content collection.
- **Reader experience:** Notes are rendered with generous typography, anchored headings, and a floating table of contents on large screens.
- **Search:** Press `/` from anywhere in the garden to open the search palette and jump directly to a note.

## Contributing

To add a new note, drop a Markdown file into the vault. Internal links written as `[[Another Note]]` will automatically resolve. Images stored alongside the note will be copied into the public assets folder.

Happy wandering!
