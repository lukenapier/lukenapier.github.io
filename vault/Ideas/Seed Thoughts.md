# Seed Thoughts

The garden thrives on tiny sparks of curiosity:

- Follow threads until patterns appear.
- Capture questions even when answers are unknown.
- Revisit old ideas with fresh eyes.

## Internal Links

Link to the [[About]] note using Obsidian syntax. When rendered, it should point to the About page within the garden.

## Code Example

```ts
const cultivate = (idea: string) => ({
  idea,
  status: 'germinating',
});
```

## Next steps

- Sketch a map of note clusters.
- Add images with `![[sprout.png]]` when available.
