Playing through Odin's Bane, thinking of how I am going to change it to SombraScape.
We're gonna max out, kill all the bosses, and take notes on what to change the entire time.

[[agility]]
[[Fishing Update]]
[[Mining Update]]
[[Coords List]]
[[Interface Notes]]
### Integrity changes
-remove the 'donate for bank button' feature

#### Less Integral changes
-change ;;itemn to be a huge container like the exchange-sets interface
-update [[quests]] system, specifically the interface. Talking to an NPC for all of them is kind of lame.
-add mining teleports
-add smithing teleports for furnace and anvil
-add 'last teleport' option to teleport interface
-add burthorpe mine
-reduce amount of slayer tasks
-multiway combat is kinda fucked at chaos dwarves
-add the rs3 rocks to mining!
#### bugs
-ahrim the blighted walking around random cities
-crystals instead of grass spawning around the trees in seers?
-corrupted scorpions play death anim instead of attack anim
-no mining animation
-npcs are crazy around catherby bank
-shadow nihils around burthope
-farming is glitchy as hell
	patches dont update when planted
	herb patches have herbs already growing
	no tool leprechaun in catherby
-burthope agility course doesn't work
-'pyramid plunder' teleport takes you to 'agility pyramid'
-skill guides dont work
-[[Dungeoneering]] is awful
-dung level up shows (i think) most recently leveled up skill
-coal bag seems glitchy, don't know how much coal is in or how to get it out. there is a player variable called getCoal
-no animation when fishing(sometimes, look into that)
-quest points is shown twice in player tab
